# Mongo API Project

Project for this week was too look at how to use Mongodb to store data, and how to query that data from your API.

## The problem

I kept the code simple so I could understand what each line of code were doing. I tried out the end points in Postman and the database in MongoDB compass before deploying my project.

What I learned this week:

- What Mongodb is
- How to model data in Mongo using Mongoose
- How to store secret information such as database passwords
- How to return useful error messages from your API endpoints
- How to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
- How to seed large amounts of data to a database
